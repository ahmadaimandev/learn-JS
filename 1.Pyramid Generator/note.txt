 - letters
 - numbers
 - dollar sign

iii. data types
1. javascript have 7 primitive data types. strings is one of them.
 - string is a sequence of character and can be enclosed with either single(') or double(") quotes
 - strings are immutable. which means once they are created, they cannot be changed 
 - the variable still can be reassigned another value

iv. print and view output
1. use console.log()

v. reassign value 
1. when variable declared with the 'let' keyword, you can reassign or change the value of that variable later on.
note: when reassigning a variable, you do not use 'let' keyword again.
