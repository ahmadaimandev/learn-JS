i. Declaring variable in javascript
1. use 'let' keyword then come up with:
 - letters
 - numbers
 - dollar sign
 - underscore
 - cannot contain spaces
 - must not begin with numbers

note: it's common practice to end statements with javascript with a semicolon ';'

ii. assign value
1. to assign value, use the assignment operator '='

iii. data types
1. javascript have 7 primitive data types. strings is one of them.
 - string is a sequence of character and can be enclosed with either single(') or double(") quotes
 - strings are immutable. which means once they are created, they cannot be changed 
 - the variable still can be reassigned another value

iv. print and view output
1. use console.log()

v. reassign value 
1. when variable declared with the 'let' keyword, you can reassign or change the value of that variable later on.
note: when reassigning a variable, you do not use 'let' keyword again.

vi. camel case
1. when variables name are more than one words, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words.
2. Camel Case means that the first word in the name entirely lowercase,
3. but the following words are all title-cased

example code:
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;


vii. assign variable to another variable
example code:

let first = "One";
let second = "Two";
second = first;

- the second variable will have value "One"
