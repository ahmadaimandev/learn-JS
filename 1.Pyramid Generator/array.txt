- Array is non-primitive that can hold series of value
- non-primitive data type differ from primitive data type in that they can hold more complex data
- primitive data types like:
 1. strings
 2. numbers
- both these can only hold one value at a time
- use squre brackets [] to denoted the array

- when array hold value, they seperated by comma's (,)
example code:
let array = ["first", "second"];

access value inside array
- using the index of the value
example:
console.log(array[0]);
- an index is a number represent positions of the value in the array
- starting from 0 for the first value

- array are special because they are considered mutable which means you can change the value at an index directly

example code:
this code would assign the number 25 to the second element in the array:
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array[1] = 25;
console.log(array); // prints [1, 25, 3]


length property
- use ".length" property of an array - this returns the number of elements in the array
example code:
array[array.length - 1]
- it will returns the number of elements in the array. by subtracting 1, you get index of the last elements in the array 

array method
- array have their own method. first we will explore the:
1. push() method
- this allows to 'push' a value to the end of an array.
example code:
array.push(12);

2. pop() method
- remove last element from an array and returns that element.
- when returns value, you can think of its giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code.
