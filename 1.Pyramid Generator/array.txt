- Array is non-primitive that can hold series of value
- non-primitive data type differ from primitive data type in that they can hold more complex data
- primitive data types like:
 1. strings
 2. numbers
- both these can only hold one value at a time
- use squre brackets [] to denoted the array

- when array hold value, they seperated by comma's (,)
example code:
let array = ["first", "second"];

access value inside array
- using the index of the value
example:
console.log(array[0]);
- an index is a number represent positions of the value in the array
- starting from 0 for the first value
