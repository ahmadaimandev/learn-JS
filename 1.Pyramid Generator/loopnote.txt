basic loop

1. for loop
example code:
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}

2. iterator
- iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your 'for' loop to control how the loop 
iterates or goes through your logic.

- common convention only use 'i'

example code:
for (let index = 100; "second"; "third") {

}

- To manipulate the result string, you will use different type of loop.
- specifically, a 'for....of' loop, which iterates over each item in an iterate object and temporarily assigns it to a variable

example code:
for (const value of iterable) {

}

- Note that you can use 'const' because the variable only exist for a single iteration, not during the entire loop.
